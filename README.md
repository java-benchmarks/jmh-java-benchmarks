- ### Summary of Java Performance Toolbox
    - No tool is perfect 
        - competing tools have relative strengths 
        - Always be flexible in your approach
    - Command-line monitoring tools can gather important data automatically 
        - Include gathering this monitoring data in automated performance testing
    - Tools rapidly evolve 
        - Some tools are probably already obsolete 
        - or at least have been superseded by new, superior tools 
        - Keeping up-to-date in this area is important
